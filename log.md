# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: October 10, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Added test cases for the determine winner function in Arboretum and added the graveyard class 

**Thoughts:** This was interesting: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33533148/how-do-i-type-hint-a-method-with-the-type-of-the-enclosing-class
How to do type hints when you're type hinting the class itself. Tried the from __ future __ import annotations solution, but it threw an error.
Seems like it messed up how the Player class was being interpreted in an unexpected way. Would like to understand what __future__is better
