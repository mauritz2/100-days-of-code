**Today's Progress**: Continued on the podcast oral comprehension difficulty assesser

**Learnings:**
* Open with append (e.g. ```with open("my_file.txt", "a") as f```) puts the cursor at the END Of the file. So if you then try to do ```json.load(f)```you'll get an error that there's no data. Best workaround I found was to open the file with ```r```, change the JSON, and then open the file again with ```w``` and dump the dict to overwrite the file.
