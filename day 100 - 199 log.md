**Today's Progress**: Continued on the podcast oral comprehension difficulty assesser

**Learnings:**
* Open with append (e.g. ```with open("my_file.txt", "a") as f```) puts the cursor at the END Of the file. So if you then try to do ```json.load(f)```you'll get an error that there's no data. Best workaround I found was to open the file with ```r```, change the JSON, and then open the file again with ```w``` and dump the dict to overwrite the file.

### Day 3: July 13, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Did some exercises from Bayesian Statistics the Fun Way
**Learnings:**
* Combinatronics is used to calculate the number of ways you can get a specific outcome. Formula for "5 chooses 1" below. 
```
from math import factorial
n = 5
k = 1
num_possible_ways = factorial(n) / (factorial(k) * factorial(n-k))
--> 5.0 (i.e., there are 5 ways for 1 out of 5 successes to occur)
```

### Day 4: December 3, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Worked on advent of code
**Learnings:**
* ```re.findall()``` doesn't match overlapping strings. User ```re.finditer(pattern, str)``` to find overlapping matches
* ```re.match()```only matches at beginning of string. Use ```re.search()```to find anywhere in string
* Syntax for matching strict amount of anything is ```{x,y}``` with no space

### Day 5: December 5, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Worked on advent of code
**Learnings:**
* Use ```my_obj__dict__()```to dump the vars of an instance
