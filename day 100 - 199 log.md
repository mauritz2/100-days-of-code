### Day 0: July 10, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Continued on the podcast oral comprehension difficulty assesser

**Learnings:**
* Open with append (e.g. ```with open("my_file.txt", "a") as f```) puts the cursor at the END Of the file. So if you then try to do ```json.load(f)```you'll get an error that there's no data. Best workaround I found was to open the file with ```r```, change the JSON, and then open the file again with ```w``` and dump the dict to overwrite the file.

### Day 3: July 13, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Did some exercises from Bayesian Statistics the Fun Way
**Learnings:**
* Combinatronics is used to calculate the number of ways you can get a specific outcome. Formula for "5 chooses 1" below. 
```
from math import factorial
n = 5
k = 1
num_possible_ways = factorial(n) / (factorial(k) * factorial(n-k))
--> 5.0 (i.e., there are 5 ways for 1 out of 5 successes to occur)
```

### Day 4: December 3, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Worked on advent of code
**Learnings:**
* ```re.findall()``` doesn't match overlapping strings. User ```re.finditer(pattern, str)``` to find overlapping matches
* ```re.match()```only matches at beginning of string. Use ```re.search()```to find anywhere in string
* Syntax for matching strict amount of anything is ```{x,y}``` with no space

### Day 5: December 5, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Worked on advent of code
**Learnings:**
* Use ```my_obj__dict__()```to dump the vars of an instance

### Day 6: December 9, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Worked on advent of code
**Learnings:**
* No need to define ```re.compile()``` can also just use the pattern, e.g., ```re.findinter(r"[0-9]", data)```
* ```{1, 2, 3}``` defines a set
* ```&```is a set operator that returns common elements between two sets. E.g., ```{"a", "b", "c"} & {"a", 2, 3}```--> ```{"a"}```
* ```{("a", "b")}```becomes a set, ```{("a", "b"):"c"}```becomes a dict
* Split first row into a special var by doing ```heading, *rows = my_str.split()```
* Use ```reduce(func, iterarable)```from functools to reduce the iterable into a single value from left to right

### Day 7: December 10, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Worked on advent of code
**Learnings:**
* Use following pattern to find the key to the highest val in a dict ```max(my_dict, key=my_dict.get)```. Returns the first key if there are ties

### Day 8: December 14, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Worked on advent of code
**Learnings:**
* Use ```str.center()```to pad data with a specific character, e.g., ```str.center(target_length, "#"```)

### Day 9: December 17, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Worked on advent of code
**Learnings:**
* Use ```itertools.combinations```to combine into pairs ```combinations(my_list, 2)```- default gives unique pairs without matching IDs to themselves
* The definition of ```zip()```is that it takes an iterable and creates tuples until it's all the way through the shortest iterable. If you use ```zip(*my_2d_list)```on a 2D list it transposes the list! Each column becomes a tuple so need ```map(list, zip(*my_2d_list))```to do a full 2d transpose

### Day 10: December 23, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Worked on advent of code
**Learnings:**
* Lists and dicts are unhashable, meaning a function that takes lists or dicts as an input can't be cached. For cashing to work parameters needs to be hashable
* Using the ```*``` operator on two lists will result in a 2D matrix where the rows are copies of each other. Only way to avoid is to use list comprehension ```matrix = [["."]] * len(data[0]) for _ in range(len(data))]```
* ```cache```and ```lrucache```is basically the same caching decorator, use cache

### Day 11: December 24, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Worked on advent of code
**Learnings:**
* ```heapq```transforms a reulary list into a binary heap, creating a priority queue. The element with the highest priority will always be at the front. Use ```heapq.heappush```to push a new item with associated priority to the list.

### Day 11: December 25, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Worked on advent of code
**Learnings:**
* To split horizontally by a new line, read as string and thens split by newline ```f.read().split("\n\n)```

### Day 12: December 26, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Worked on advent of code
**Learnings:**
* Main learning from the more complex advent of code problems - break problem down into smaller functions or use oop. Otherwise at the end when it finally runs but the number is wrong it's impossible to troubleshoot what's wrong

### Day 13: December 27, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Worked on advent of code
**Learnings:**
* Generating a generator using ```for```and ```yield```has some advantages compared to other methods like list comprehension. For instance the generator only generates when needed, so it can have better memory and performance. It also allows for more complex generation than list comprehension. It can also do infinite generation, e.g., all even numbers, which list comprehension could never do since it's an infinite series.

### Day 14: December 28, 2023
**Today's Progress**: Worked on advent of code
**Learnings:**
* Named tuples are very useful, e.g., 
```
from collections import namedtuple
LinearEquation = namedtuple("my_equation", ["y", "k", "x", "m"])
l = LinearEquation(1, 2, 1, 1)
l.k
>> 2
```
* How many pairs can you get from a list of 5 items?
```
from math import factorial as f
from math import pow as p
l_len = 5

# If order doesn't matter and an item can't pair with itself
# >> Combination formula
num_pairs = f(l_len) // (f(2) * f(l_len - 2))
print(num_pairs)

# If order does matter and an item can't pair with itself
# >> Permutation formula
num_pairs = f(l_len) // f(l_len - 2)
print(num_pairs)

# If order does matter and you can pair with itself
# Perumations with replacement
num_pairs = p(l_len, 2)
print(num_pairs)
```
