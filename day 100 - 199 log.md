**Today's Progress**: Continued on the podcast oral comprehension difficulty assesser

**Learnings:**
* Open with append (e.g. ```with open("my_file.txt", "a") as f```) puts the cursor at the END Of the file. So if you then try to do ```json.load(f)```you'll get an error that there's no data. Best workaround I found was to open the file with ```r```, change the JSON, and then open the file again with ```w``` and dump the dict to overwrite the file.

### Day 3: July 13, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Did some exercises from Bayesian Statistics the Fun Way
**Learnings:**
* Combinatronics is used to calculate the number of ways you can get a specific outcome. Formula for "5 chooses 1" below. 
```
from math import factorial
n = 5
k = 1
num_possible_ways = factorial(n) / (factorial(k) * factorial(n-k))
--> 5.0 (i.e., there are 5 ways for 1 out of 5 successes to occur)
```

### Day 4: December 3, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Worked on advent of code
**Learnings:**
* ```re.findall()``` doesn't match overlapping strings. User ```re.finditer(pattern, str)``` to find overlapping matches
* ```re.match()```only matches at beginning of string. Use ```re.search()```to find anywhere in string
* Syntax for matching strict amount of anything is ```{x,y}``` with no space

### Day 5: December 5, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Worked on advent of code
**Learnings:**
* Use ```my_obj__dict__()```to dump the vars of an instance

### Day 6: December 9, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Worked on advent of code
**Learnings:**
* No need to define ```re.compile()``` can also just use the pattern, e.g., ```re.findinter(r"[0-9]", data)```
* ```{1, 2, 3}``` defines a set
* ```&```is a set operator that returns common elements between two sets. E.g., ```{"a", "b", "c"} & {"a", 2, 3}```--> ```{"a"}```
* ```{("a", "b")}```becomes a set, ```{("a", "b"):"c"}```becomes a dict
* Split first row into a special var by doing ```heading, *rows = my_str.split()```
* Use ```reduce(func, iterarable)```from functools to reduce the iterable into a single value from left to right

### Day 7: December 10, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Worked on advent of code
**Learnings:**
* Use following pattern to find the key to the highest val in a dict ```max(my_dict, key=my_dict.get)```. Returns the first key if there are ties

### Day 8: December 14, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Worked on advent of code
**Learnings:**
* Use ```str.center()```to pad data with a specific character, e.g., ```str.center(target_length, "#"```)

### Day 9: December 17, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Worked on advent of code
**Learnings:**
* Use ```itertools.combinations```to combine into pairs ```combinations(my_list, 2)```- default gives unique pairs without matching IDs to themselves
* The definition of ```zip()```is that it takes an iterable and creates tuples until it's all the way through the shortest iterable. If you use ```zip(*my_2d_list)```on a 2D list it transposes the list! Each column becomes a tuple so need ```map(list, zip(*my_2d_list))```to do a full 2d transpose

### Day 10: December 23, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Worked on advent of code
**Learnings:**
* Lists and dicts are unhashable, meaning a function that takes lists or dicts as an input can't be cached. For cashing to work parameters needs to be hashable
* Using the ```*``` operator on two lists will result in a 2D matrix where the rows are copies of each other. Only way to avoid is to use list comprehension ```matrix = [["."]] * len(data[0]) for _ in range(len(data))]```
* ```cache```and ```lrucache```is basically the same caching decorator, use cache
